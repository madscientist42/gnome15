STATUS OF GNOME15
=================

Gnome15 is currently **not complete maintained**.  In fact, this fork of 
the sources is here for the sole purpose of winnowing out a bunch of the 
stuff to come up with a more svelte, optimized version of the system that 
removes a _*BUNCH*_ of the old cruft (including all the kernel support 
drivers- those were...ill advised...and frowned upon at this time by the 
LKML crowd and for good reasons...), putting the driver and services 
from this project on a more maintainable footing.

Ultimately, only the plugins themselves are largely not "subject to 
reconsideration" in this fork of the forks because they don't need to 
change except minimally at most right now.  Driver, daemon, etc. are not 
exactly what I'd call "great" and the code's suffered bitrot due to drift 
in the Python environments on most distributions since this code all drives 
hardware directly or provides daemon services.  

The original primary repository has been unavailable since November 2014 
due to a hosting server crash that never got recovered from.

This fork was derived from a fork that is periodically extended from CMoH, 
Huskygnarr and others, and was made from another fork that was made to add 
a feature and has not been updated since November 2013, and it appears to 
be the latest snapshot of the repository that is currently publicly available.  
This is the working fork associated with the currently extant fork directly 
associated with gnome15.org and had updates from the people associated
with the same as of 6 months ago (08/30/2016).  It was forked because of 
the nature of what I (madscientist42) am about to do with it and TO it, due 
to my having a clean, nearly complete HID raw library interface to G15 devices
and soon G19 and other Logitech based keyboards that is much, much more stable 
than the ones bundled in this project.  I'm applying a massive wrecking ball
to everything with the intent of providing this back to the project or 
maintaining the fork under the auspices of a new name/code core if it's 
not accepted back.
